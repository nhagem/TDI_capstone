Peer to peer lending allows investors to invest directly in specific loans. Investors must thus make a judgment call about which loans are likely to be paid, versus charged off. The Lending Club is a company that connects investors with approved loans. I am using the Lending Club's dataset of all approved loans to build a tool for investors to determine which loans are worth investing in. I have combined and cleaned the static data available from the Lending Club to produce a dataset of loans that have either been completely paid, or charged off. Of the 31 features available to investors, I will use a random forest for feature selection to reduce the number of features necessary for input into the investor tool. Then, I will use principal components analysis for dimension reduction, and will feed the resulting variables into a hurdle model to model first the likelihood that a loan will be charged off, then the length of time the loan will survive before being charged off. The model will form the basis for a Heroku app as a tool for investors in the lending club.
